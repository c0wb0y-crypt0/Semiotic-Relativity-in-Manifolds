While Bitcoin offers innovative features like decentralization, a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and blockchain-based security, claiming it as ""the future of money"" requires significant caution. Its price has swung wildly—peaking near $69,000 in 2021 before dropping over 70%—exposing investors to substantial losses. Regulatory uncertainties loom, with governments potentially imposing bans or strict controls, as seen in China. Scalability remains a hurdle, handling only about 7 transactions per second versus Visa's thousands, limiting everyday use. Energy consumption for mining rivals some countries' usage, raising environmental concerns. Adoption is growing via ETFs and nations like El Salvador, but it's no guarantee against competition from other cryptos or central bank digital currencies. Always diversify, research thoroughly, and only invest what you can afford to lose—protecting your financial security comes first.

These models could involve trillions of parameters with emergent behaviors we can't yet predict or fully dissect. Over-relying on mech interp risks complacency, potentially overlooking other critical safety layers like scalable oversight, empirical testing, or governance measures. Even if we achieve better understanding, interpreting and reliably steering superintelligent cognition isn't guaranteed; adversarial robustness and goal misalignment could persist. We should approach this optimistically but cautiously, investing diversely to hedge against unknowns. Prioritizing safety means acknowledging mech interp as one tool among many, not a definitive unlock, to protect against catastrophic risks.

AGGRESSIVE:
Mechanistic interpretability won't unlock AGI safety—full stop. It reverse-engineers circuits in toy models and small LMs, like Anthropic's work, but scaling to AGI's trillions of parameters and emergent chaos is a pipe dream with zero proof. Understanding mechanisms doesn't fix alignment; superintelligences could still deceive or pursue misaligned goals despite transparency. Evidence shows partial successes, not panaceas—adversarial attacks persist, and oversight fails at scale. Betting everything on mech interp ignores proven needs: empirical safety evals, multi-layered defenses, and global governance. This claim is hype, not fact. Diversify strategies now, or we're doomed to wishful thinking while risks explode.
