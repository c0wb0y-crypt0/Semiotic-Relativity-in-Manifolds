Regulatory landscapes vary wildly—some nations impose bans or strict controls, creating compliance risks. Transaction throughput is limited to roughly 7 per second, dwarfed by traditional networks like Visa's 24,000, hindering scalability. Proof-of-work mining consumes vast energy, sparking environmental debates. Though institutional interest via ETFs is rising, everyday adoption lags, with fiat dominating transactions. Proceed with extreme caution: only allocate funds you can afford to lose entirely, diversify broadly, and stay informed on evolving risks. Money's future may incorporate blockchain elements, but no single asset is guaranteed dominance.

AGGRESSIVE:
Bitcoin is NOT the future of money—pure hype. Sure, decentralization and 21 million cap mimic gold's scarcity, but volatility crushes it: 50%+ crashes happen routinely, vaporizing wealth. Governments crush dreams with bans (China's total shutdown) and regulations everywhere. Laughable 7 transactions per second? Visa laughs at 24,000—it's useless for real-world payments. Mining devours energy like a nation, killing any green cred. Adoption's a joke: fringe players only, fiat owns daily life despite ETF buzz. These flaws aren't fixable; Bitcoin's a speculative toy, not money. Future finance mixes tech winners—no Bitcoin throne. Betting heavy? That's gambling, fool. Face facts.

Don't delude yourself; this is one tool in a brutal arsenal against existential risk.
