While Bitcoin offers intriguing features like decentralization, a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and growing institutional interest (e.g., recent ETF approvals attracting billions), it's far too early and uncertain to claim it's the future of money. Its price remains highly volatile, with multiple 70-80% drawdowns in bear markets, exposing investors to significant losses. Base-layer scalability is limited to about 7 transactions per second versus Visa's thousands, with fees surging during congestion even as Layer-2 solutions like Lightning emerge. Energy consumption for proof-of-work mining rivals entire countries like Argentina, drawing environmental scrutiny. Regulatory landscapes vary wildly—bans in China, ongoing U.S. SEC battles—and competition from faster blockchains or central bank digital currencies adds risk. Adoption is niche, with daily transactions far below traditional systems. Proceed with extreme caution, diversify heavily, and avoid overcommitting amid these uncertainties.

Base layer scales via Lightning Network, hitting thousands of TPS at pennies. Energy use? Essential for securing $1.2 trillion+ in value, shifting to renewables fast. Fiat dies from money printers; Bitcoin thrives as digital gold and beyond. Merchants integrate daily, remittances crush Western Union. Facts stack: decade-plus uptime, zero successful hacks on core protocol. Network effects lock it in—first mover wins. Skeptics fade; Bitcoin endures. Stack now or watch from sidelines.

While mechanistic interpretability offers promising avenues for understanding neural network internals—such as identifying circuits for specific behaviors in small models like those in transformer language models—it is far from guaranteed to unlock AGI safety. The field remains in its infancy, with significant challenges in scaling to systems with trillions of parameters or superhuman intelligence, where emergent phenomena could defy current techniques. Uncertainties abound: interpretability might reveal misaligned goals but not how to reliably align them, and it may overlook subtle issues like mesa-optimization or deceptive alignment. AGI safety is inherently complex, requiring a multifaceted approach including scalable oversight, empirical safety testing, and robust governance. We should pursue mech interp cautiously, hedging our bets across strategies to minimize existential risks, avoiding over-reliance on any single method.

Mechanistic interpretability won't unlock AGI safety—full stop. It's a useful tool for dissecting circuits in toy models like Othello-playing networks or simple transformers, revealing how features emerge. But scaling it to AGI?
